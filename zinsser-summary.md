# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Pen Han Chang

We use unnecessary words in our writing. William
Zinsser states a really important point. Every 
sentence can eliminate many not useful words. When 
reader can understand the sentence, it doesn't need
any additional words. Sentence may become messy.
William called it cluttering. Cluttering can make 
reader miss the point that writer was trying to 
make. It is an unnecessary writing style. In our 
life, we always hanging on something we think is 
beautiful, but pointless and useless. William 
suggests writer to use simplicity style. It will 
make the sentences easier to understand.
